- **Tests**: Add or improve unit/integration tests.
- **Code review**: Provide constructive feedback on pull requests.

### 3. Coding Guidelines

#### Flutter/Dart

- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) and [Flutter Style Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/advanced/style).
- Use clear naming, consistent formatting, and add documentation for complex logic.

- Add docstrings and comments to explain non-trivial logic.
- Handle exceptions gracefully and validate inputs.

### 4. Submitting Changes

- **Pull Requests**:
  - Clearly describe what you changed and why.
  - Reference related issues.
  - Ensure all tests pass (`flutter test` for Dart, `pytest` for Python).
  - Keep PRs focusedâ€”avoid mixing unrelated changes.

### 5. Code Review Process

- All pull requests are reviewed for quality, maintainability, and adherence to project standards.
- Be responsive to feedback and willing to revise your code.
- See [Code Review Instructions](.github/copilot-instructions.md) for more details.

### 6. Dependencies

- Use only necessary and well-supported packages.
- Update relevant files (`pubspec.yaml` for Dart, `requirements.txt`/`pyproject.toml` for Python).
- Run `flutter pub get` or appropriate Python commands after editing dependencies.

### 7. Reporting Issues & Requests
